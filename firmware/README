The primary firmware source code for GreatFET devices is greatfet_usb.  Most
of the other directories contain firmware source code for test and development.
The common directory contains source code shared by multiple GreatFET firmware
projects.


The firmware is set up for compilation with the GCC toolchain available here:

https://code.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

Required dependency:

https://github.com/mossmann/libopencm3

If you are using git, the preferred way to install libopencm3 is to use the
submodule:

$ cd ..
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ cd firmware/libopencm3
$ make


To build and install a standard firmware image for GreatFET:

$ cd greatfet_usb
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ greatfet_spiflash -w greatfet_usb.bin


For loading firmware into RAM with DFU you will also need:

http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/

To start up GreatFET in DFU mode, hold down the DFU button while powering it
on or while pressing and releasing the RESET button.

With dfu-util and dfu-suffix (from the dfu-util package) installed and with the
GreatFET operating in DFU mode, you can build firmware for RAM and load it
with:

$ cd greatfet_usb
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DRUN_FROM=RAM ..
$ make greatfet_usb-program

Alternatively you can load a prebuilt .dfu file with:

$ dfu-util --device 1fc9:000c --alt 0 --download greatfet_usb_ram.dfu
